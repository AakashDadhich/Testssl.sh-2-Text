# Testssl Log Parser - Bash
**Note: this is now deprecated, and has been replaced with a far more efficient [script written in Python3](https://github.com/AakashDadhich/testssl-parser-python)**

---

Quick and dirty bash script to parse testssl.sh .log files into a .txt file, sorting affected hosts by which vulnerabilities/misconfigurations were identified. This script comes in particularly handy when you have many testssl.sh log files to parse through, but only outputs most common issues found.
